# Disaster-Management

## Introduction:
There exist systems to manage emergency or disaster situations. However, these systems lack quick communication and the ability to predict and visualize the locations of several response teams in different areas simultaneously. We propose an approach to spontaneously pass critical information from a mobile application. The same data services will be used by the web application, which is out of the scope of this research.
